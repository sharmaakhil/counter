# Counter
Test project for creating counters through REST based API's. This project is built using gradle and Springboot. I have used Jersey for REST API and Jetty.

The project contains 4 mains API's for the counter.

`POST /{counter}`

This API is used for creating a counter.

`GET /{counter}`

This API is used for getting the value of the specified counter.

`PUT /{counter}`

This API is used for incrementing the value of the specified counter.

`GET /all`

This API is used for getting the values of all the counters.
